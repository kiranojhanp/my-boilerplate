# Feature-Based Architecture Refactor

## ✅ Completed Refactoring

The codebase has been successfully refactored from a traditional layer-based structure to a modern **feature-based architecture**. This provides better organization, scalability, and maintainability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. **Feature-Based Organization**

- Each feature is self-contained in its own directory
- Features include all related schemas, services, routers, and exports
- Easy to add, remove, or modify individual features

### 2. **Zod-First Type Safety**

- All types are inferred from Zod schemas (no manual interfaces)
- Runtime validation with compile-time type safety
- Consistent validation patterns across all features

### 3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**

- **Schemas**: Data validation and type definitions
- **Services**: Business logic and data operations
- **Routers**: API endpoint definitions
- **Shared**: Cross-cutting concerns and utilities

### 4. **Scalable Structure**

- Easy to add new features without touching existing code
- Shared utilities prevent code duplication
- Clear import/export patterns

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Authentication System

- ✅ User registration/login with JWT tokens
- ✅ Secure password hashing with Bun's Argon2 support
- ✅ Account lockout protection
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Protected route middleware

### Todo Management

- ✅ Full CRUD operations for todos
- ✅ Subtask management
- ✅ Priority levels and categories
- ✅ Due date handling
- ✅ Tag system
- ✅ Time tracking (estimated vs actual)

### Advanced Validation

- ✅ Complex nested object validation
- ✅ File upload validation
- ✅ Search parameter validation
- ✅ Batch operation validation
- ✅ SuperJSON complex type handling

### Health & Monitoring

- ✅ Health check endpoints (basic, readiness, liveness)
- ✅ Metrics collection and reporting
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## 🎯 Benefits of New Architecture

### For Developers

- **Faster Development**: Find and modify feature-specific code quickly
- **Better Testing**: Test features in isolation
- **Easier Onboarding**: Understand one feature at a time
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Multiple developers can work on different features

### For Maintenance

- **Isolated Changes**: Modifications to one feature don't affect others
- **Clear Dependencies**: Shared code is explicitly defined
- **Easier Debugging**: Follow the flow within a single feature
- **Better Documentation**: Each feature is self-documenting

### For Scaling

- **Microservice Ready**: Features can be extracted into separate services
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different features
- **Independent Deployment**: Features could be deployed separately
- **Technology Diversity**: Different features could use different tech stacks

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development with hot reload
bun run dev

# Production build
bun run build
bun run start

# Run tests
bun run test:api
bun run test:enhanced
bun run test:todo
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create a new directory in `src/features/`
2. Add schemas.ts with Zod validation
3. Add service.ts with business logic
4. Add router.ts with tRPC endpoints
5. Add index.ts with clean exports
6. Import the router in `src/trpc/router.ts`

### API Endpoints

- **Health**: `/trpc/health.*`
- **Auth**: `/trpc/auth.*`
- **Hello**: `/trpc/hello.*`
- **Todo**: `/trpc/todo.*`
- **Validation**: `/trpc/validation.*`

## 🔍 Type Safety Guarantees

- ✅ All API inputs/outputs are Zod-validated
- ✅ Types are automatically inferred from schemas
- ✅ No manual type definitions required
- ✅ Runtime and compile-time safety
- ✅ SuperJSON handles complex types (Date, Map, Set, BigInt, etc.)

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Secure password hashing (Argon2)
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Account lockout protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Security headers

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- ✅ Structured logging with context
- ✅ Prometheus-compatible metrics
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Request/response tracking
- ✅ Error handling and reporting

## 🔄 Migration Status

### ✅ Completed

- Feature-based directory structure
- All schemas converted to Zod with type inference
- Service layer extraction
- Router modularization
- Shared utilities organization
- Main server refactoring
- Build and test verification

### 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Database integration (replace in-memory stores)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- API documentation generation
- OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- Docker optimization
- Kubernetes deployment updates

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Always use Zod schemas** for data validation
2. **Infer types** from schemas, don't create manual interfaces
3. **Keep features isolated** - avoid cross-feature dependencies
4. **Use shared utilities** for common functionality
5. **Follow the service pattern** for business logic
6. **Export cleanly** through feature index files
7. **Log meaningfully** with context and structured data

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable APIs with excellent developer experience and type safety.
